# This is currently not cryptographically-secure. CSPRNGs are planned to be added in the future, but do not use this in it's current state for cryptographically-secure random number generation.

# nanorand

`nanorand` is a Rust crate, meant for fast, high-level, zero-dependency random number generation.

## Examples

```rs
use nanorand::{RNG, WyRand};

fn main() {
    let mut rng = WyRand::new();
    println!("Random 64-bit number: {}", rng.generate::<u64>());
}
```


## RNG Implementations

**RNG**|**nanorand type**|**Output Size**|**Cryptographically Secure**|**Speed (Internal State)**|**Notes**|**Original Implementation**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
wyrand|[nanohash::WyRand](src/rand/wyrand.rs)|64 bits (`u64`)|ðŸš«|1.4 ns||https://github.com/lemire/testingRNG/blob/master/source/wyrand.h
Pcg64|[nanohash::Pcg64](src/rand/pcg64.rs)|64 bits (`u64`)|ðŸš«|7 ns||https://github.com/rkern/pcg64


## Entropy Sources

* Unix-like (Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD) - first `/dev/urandom`, else `/dev/random`, else system time. (`#[forbid(unsafe_code)]`)
* Windows - `BCryptGenRandom` with system-preferred RNG. (`#[deny(unsafe_code)]`)

## Manually Seeding

`nanorand` by default has the `ctor` feature enabled, which will seed the global state using the default entropy source.  
If needed, you can seed it yourself:

```rs
fn main() {
    nanorand::seed_global(42);
}
```

## Feature Flags

* `std` (default) - Enables Rust `std` lib features, such as seeding from OS entropy sources.  
* `wyrand` (default) - Enable the "wyrand" RNG.
* `pcg64` (default) - Enable the "Pcg64" RNG.
