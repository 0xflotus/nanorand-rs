# nanorand

`nanorand` is a Rust crate, meant for fast  random number generation with **zero required dependencies**.

## Examples

```rs
use nanorand::{RNG, WyRand};

fn main() {
    let mut rng = WyRand::new();
    println!("Random 64-bit number: {}", rng.generate::<u64>());
}
```

## Why should I use this over...

* `rand` - The standard rand crate is a complex beast. It contains unsafe code in the core implementations, and while it has much more options than we do, that's kind of the point. We're straight to the point, while rand is everything and the kitchen sink.  
* `fastrand`, `oorandom`, `random-fast-rng`, or `randomize` - These are all minimal, zero-dep implementations of the PCG family of RNGs (Pcg32 and Pcg64). While these are decent, they are _much_ slower than wyrand (which beats the speed of these Pcg32 implementations while providing 64 random bits), and do not provide CSPRNGs.  
* `getrandom` - The getrandom crate just provides OS entropy sources. It is not meant for random number generation. In fact, it is useful for seeding nanorand's RNGs on platforms where we can't do that ourselves.

Benchmark output (from the [benches/randbench.rs](benches/randbench.rs)) [can be seen in this text file](benchmark-run-9-15-2020.txt). It was ran on a `Standard_D4s_v3` Azure virtual machine.

## Entropy Sources

* Unix-like (Linux, Android, macOS, iOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD) - first `/dev/urandom`, else `/dev/random`, else system time. (`#[forbid(unsafe_code)]`)
* Windows - `BCryptGenRandom` with system-preferred RNG. (`#[deny(unsafe_code)]`)

## Feature Flags

* `std` (default) - Enables Rust `std` lib features, such as seeding from OS entropy sources.  
* `wyrand` (default) - Enable the "wyrand" RNG.
* `pcg64` (default) - Enable the "Pcg64" RNG.
* `chacha` (**Nightly-only**) - Enable the "ChaCha" RNG.
* `rdseed` - On x86/x86_64 platforms, the `rdseed` intrinsic will be used when OS entropy isn't available.
* `zeroize` - Implement the [Zeroize](https://crates.io/crates/zeroize) trait for all RNGs.
